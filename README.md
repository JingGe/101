# 101- ACAP for ASAP

Building distributed systems is complicated. Many different technologies have been used either as the fundamental components or as the tools to make the development to be more efficient. In addition to this, many modern distributed platforms are using multiple languages to handle different technical requirements. 

This book is written for developers who have strong Java background and want to extend their boundary and move to the next level. The goal is to help you getting off the ground ASAP. In order to accomplish this goal, the content will be kept as compact as possible\(ACAP\). There will be no comprehensive examples and explanations which will take much of your time to read through. Once you understand the foundation of the technology you can refer to the official document while you are playing with it.

Real projects will be used as examples to let you get your hand dirty at the first time. This is the key different between this book and other books using Hello World! examples. At the time of this writing, I am working on the Ray project. Most examples will come from it. Please take a look at [https://github.com/ray-project/ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)
