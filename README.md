Building distributed systems is complicated. Many different technologies have been used either as the fundamental components or as the tools to make the development to be more efficient. In addition to this, many modern distributed platforms are using multiple languages to handle different technical requirements. 

This book is written for developers who have strong Java background and want to extend their boundary and move to the next level. The goal is to help you getting off the ground ASAP. In order to accomplish this goal, the content will be kept as compact as possible\(ACAP\). There will be no comprehensive examples and explanations which will take much of your time to read through.
