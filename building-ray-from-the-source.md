# Building Ray from the Source on Mac

The official document about this topic could be found at: [https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\#building-ray-from-source](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#building-ray-from-source)

As I followed the introduction, I have run into many problems. This document will note down everything as I built the Ray from the source.

## Install Python

First of all, go to App Store, download Xcode and install it.

Then install the Homebrew:

> $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$\(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\)"

Update the PATH:

> export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"

Install python, pip should be installed together automatically:

> brew install python
